                <p>First part of this module was to create individually a story without words.
                    It meant creating a short video that was telling a story but without any dialog so words.
                    I learned how to edit a video in <strong>Premiere Pro</strong> and how to film different shots.</p>
                <p>The timing for this assignment was really good as I was travelling home and decided to use the whole
                    journey for this task.
                    I wanted to surprise my family with some cakes that I was bringing from Copenhagen.</p>
                <p>That's why my video is about 'The Eclair Dispatch'!
                    <br>(The name isn't at all inspired by a movie "The French Dispatch" which I had seen a couple
                    days before;))

            <p>Pre-production part 1 was a first group assignment in this theme.</p>
            <p>This assignment was a group task. After each of us created 'a story without words' we had to come up with
                the idea for another video a promoting one
                for
                the client and this was the focus of this assignment.
                Together we decided on a simple storyline to ephasize the message behind the whole video.</p>

                <p>The focus of this assignment was to prepare a more visualised version of our idea.</p>
                <p>It was about drawing main shots from the video to make the filming process easier for us. Thanks to
                    that we
                    exactly knew
                    what different shots we needed to film.</p>
                <p>Due to typical Danish weather the filming part wasn't the easiest one as we struggled with catching
                    any light.
                    But somehow we worked despite these inconvenience and succesfully filmed all the shots we wanted.

                <p>Due to coronavirus our group decided to do the pitch online. </p>
                <p>We learned how prepare it as a <strong>Pecha Kucha</strong> presentation.
                    It is a special kind as it constists of 20 slides and each lasts 20 seconds.</p>
                <p>We wanted for it to consist of all the important tasks we did during this process and show our work.
