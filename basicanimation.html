                    This theme's assingment goal was to <strong>create a website with a simple game</strong>. </p>
                <p>We were introduced to new coding language: <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
                    It turned out to be way harder for me than I thought but I managed to create a really simple game
                    using it.
                    Despite that I think that JavaScript is a very useful tool when coding an interesting website.</p>
                <p>We were supposed to make basic animations first in CSS and then using JavaScript functions make them
                    into a game.</p>
                <p>I created a game called Spooktober Fox where the aim was to collect items connected with Fall season
                    so that the fox would be happy and turn red.</p>

                    Creating a paper prototype helped me develop the main idea for the game. </p>
                <p>It also made me think about how are the characters going to be shown and how many of the items should
                    I
                    create later.</p>
                <p>Testing my paper prototype helped me make changes to the general display of each item and assured me
                    that it was understandable and easy to follow.</p>

                <p>
                    Our requirements for the game were to create a game with a main character and its background story
                    so that the user would actually be motivated to win.</p>
                <p>It was also supposed to contain good and bad objects that the user would click on and either gain a
                    point or lose a life.
                    In the meantime the time is running and not having collected enough points before it runs out would
                    result
                    in losing the game.</p>
                <p>In my game the main character was a fox which fur was half grey and half red.</p>
                <p>He wanted to get in the Fall mood and turn fully red fur which could be achieved by collecting 5
                    objects connected with October.
                    Clicking on items connected with other seasons would result in losing points and losing the game
                    with fox's fur turning entirely to grey.</p>

                    The design part was my favourite throughout the whole theme.</p>
                <p>I used <strong>Illustrator</strong> for making all my graphics to the game. </p>
                <p>I decided to go with a colour palette that was warm and friendly.
                    Actually all the colors I used were from a photo of a sunrise which I had taken a couple of days
                    before.</p>
                <p>I used simple shapes and a background with a gradient to make it interesting but keep the design
                    minimalistic.</p>
                <p>When it comes to the falling objects at first I created a pumpkin as a good item and a snowman as
                    a bad one but after receiving feedback for the whole assignment I decided to change it for a leaf
                    and a snowflake as I feel like the design is more coherent that way.</p>
