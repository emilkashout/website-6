                <p>The focus of this assingment was to <strong>create a mobile view version of a website</strong> about
                    a topic connected
                    with history of arts.
                    <br>The task was also to <strong>edit the text</strong> about russian constructivism and choose
                    images to
                    make it more clear and easy to follow.
                    <br>It was the very beggining of getting familiar with coding languagues: <strong>HTML</strong> and
                    <strong>CSS</strong>.
                    <br>We learned how to code using <strong>semantic markup</strong> so writing the code properly.
                    <br>Also during this assingment we were introduced to <strong>gestalt laws</strong> on which the
                    design of a website
                    should be based.
                </p>
                <p>In my design I used different gestalt laws: law of common region, law of similarity and law of
                    proximity.
                </p>
                <p>I started with editting the given text about history of art movement. Then I tried my hand at
                    <strong>Adobe
                        XD</strong> for the first time where I <strong>prepared the prototype</strong> of the website.

                <p>The focus of this assingment was to create both a <strong>desktop and mobile view</strong> version of
                    a website.
                    Choice of the topic was up to us(hopefully the one that is connected with our interests;)).
                    The first task was to choose one design style as the main theme for the webpage.
                </p>
                <p>I created one of my first <strong>moodboards</strong> and also I learned how to <strong>create a
                        wireframe</strong>
                    which is a
                    basic
                    first sketch of how should the content be placed on the page.
                    Another thing I learned was <strong>media query</strong>. It is adjusting the code in a way that the
                    webpage would be
                    displayed
                    correctly not only on a laptop but also on the phone.
                    Also I learned different <strong>multi-device layout patterns</strong>.</p>
                <p>I decided to use Tiny Tweaks and Column Drop as I
                    wanted to adapt the style almost in the same form as in the desktop view.
                    So the only changes I made were in cutting the background a little bit from both sides and turning
                    the navigation bar into a column.
                    Also I moved the photos closer to the text than before.</p>
                <p> I decided to write about Marie Kondo's method on how to declutter space in your house.
                    I've chosen <strong>Minimalism as a main design theme</strong> for my website as I felt like it
                    matched the topic of
                    my interest the most.
                    Also in this project I started with collecting photos and writing text that would be the content of
                    the page and moved on to creating XD prototype.
                    Drawing wireframes first helped me with organizing the site using <strong>coding grid and some
                        flexbox tags</strong>.
                    For the first time I decided to organize my stylesheet in only one CSS file which made the coding
                    part easier.</p>
