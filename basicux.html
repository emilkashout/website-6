            <p>As a first part of this assingment we were introduced to different <strong>types of research</strong>.
                I started with doing a <strong>desk research</strong> which consists of finding information about a
                certain topic by
                available sources like books or internet.
                It is different from other types of researches as you aren’t creating the whole study yourself but
                basing
                your insights on someone else’s work.
                I decided to conduct this research based on multiple articles that I found online as well as searching
                through social media platforms and trying to find a pattern in which people buy online.</p>
            <p>The next way of collecting data was <strong>observation</strong>.
                I asked a friend if I can observe how she makes a purchase online and wrote down my insights.
                Another type of research I conducted was an <strong>interview</strong>.
                I prepared questions about a certain topic and asked a friend to answer them.
                Later I went through her answers and focused on what have I learned from it.</p>
            <p>The last type of research was <strong>survey</strong> that we conducted in class and later reviewed the
                most common answers and tried
                to find interesting insights out of them.</p>

                <h3>early prototypes</h3>
                <nav class="link">
                    <a href="photos/030201_Early-prototypes_teamn.pdf" class="aux">documentation</a>
                </nav>
                <p>This part of the assingment was a <strong>group task</strong>.</p>
                <p>
                    <br>We started with collecting all of group members notes, the main points that we found out during
                    research.
                    We learned a <strong>crazy 8 method</strong> for developing an idea in which you draw on 8 squares 8
                    sketches each
                    for 1 minute and that's how you may find an interesting solutions.
                    We reviewed our crazy 8s and chose our favourite ones.
                </p>
                <p>This led us to creating wireframes for the webpage and right after a <strong>paper prototype</strong>
                    which we tested
                    on other KEA students.
                    It was an easy way to find what in our idea isn't easy to follow for users which helped us with
                    making
                    changes when we made an XD prototype.</p>
                <p>Another new thing was conducting a <strong>5-second</strong> and <strong>trunk test</strong>.
                    Both focus on receving from interviewee answers about design and content of the webpage.
                    They should be short and quick so answered wihout much thinking.</p>
                <p>It was also a part of the project where we were introduced to <strong>think-aloud test</strong>.
                    The aim of it is to observe a potential user explore our prototype and talk out loud about every
                    insight that
                    comes to his/her mind.
                    This helped us focus on the things testers noticed and liked and improve the things that weren't
                    that obvious to follow.</p>

                <p>Having to create a webshop selling t-shirts the first thing we did was discussing on which
                    <strong>values
                        would we like to focus on in our brand</strong>.
                    Together we decided that it is very important so that the shop is going to promote
                    <strong>body-inclusive</strong> as
                    well as <strong>sustainable</strong> values.
                </p>
                <p>We wanted a simple, modern design and an intuitive navigation on our website.</p>
                <p>We split the tasks and followed our progress on Notion platform.
                    I was in charge of <strong>creating a logo</strong> but in the end we went with a different vision.
                    I also conducted the <strong>think aloud test</strong> and was a part of each step when it comes to
                    design and
                    describing our <strong>target audience</strong>.</p>
                <p>Our idea for including body-inclusivity in our solution was to present t-shirts on different body
                    types of women in different ages which was our target group.</p>
                <p>When it comes to sustainability we made a page which described in details what that actually means to
                    us.</p>
                <p>The last part of the assignment was preparing a <strong>presentation about our solution</strong>.</p>
